Currently 6 of the 44 references in the article come from either REJ or the RE conference [1,2,3,4,5,6]. We have searched through the journal and conference database for more references, and we found 4 more references that are closely related to our work [7,8,9,10]. We have added a discussion of these articles to the related work section, at the end of the paragraph "Requirements Engineering". This means we currently have 10 references from the Requirements Engineering Journal or presented at the Requirements Engineering series of conferences.

######## REVIEWER #1 ########

We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments. Especially the comment about the missing validation was useful since it motivated us to perform an small-scale in-house user study, which allowed us to strengthen our claims for the usefulness and usability of our framework. We’ve replied to each separate comment below.

===== COMMENT #1
The integrated meta model looks reasonable but I have some doubts about the inclusion of "critical question" in the schema. Critical questions are something that are used to identify arguments and attack links, but  I don't see them as a concept to be included in the meta model. They are part of the methodology used to build the goal model rather concepts of the language.  

===== REPLY #1
We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree critical questions should not be part of the metamodel, and we have removed them accordingly. We also have updated the text accordingly.

===== COMMENT #2
The proposed algorithms are very simple and they do not add much to the overall presentation, I think they can be summarized in the section describing the tool. 

===== REPLY #2
We agree that many algorithms are similar, and we have therefore shortened the sections containing these algorithms: sections 5.4.1 to 5.4.3 now all contain one example of the specific type of algorithm instead of two or more.

===== COMMENT #3
The methodology and the tools looks quite preliminary and without a real validation of the approach. I think this is the weakest part of the paper. Authors should demonstrate the applicability, scalability and usefulness of their approach in the real word. The tool and the modeling language should be used and evaluated by practitioners while they cope with real requirements engineering problems and complexity issues.

===== REPLY #3
We agree with the reviewer that a real validation of the approach is a necessary next step. However, we also would like to point out that an industrial strength case study is a significant amount of work, and would most likely have enough new insights for a separate paper. To give an example, it took Estrada et al. [11] about 9 months to conduct the case study. 

Since the main focus of our article is to explain the novel RationalGRL framework in detail, we feel that adding such an extensive study to the current article may be too much content. Still, we agree that having no validation at all is limiting, so we have performed a small-scale user study in order to provide an initial validation of our framework. This empirical study was performed amongst ==> TODO(marcvanzee): ADD NUMBER HERE  <== participants, each with a computer science background. 

We have added a section "Validation" (Section 7) where we describe the results of the validation.

I think we need to include some references on empirical work that has been done on goal modelling. I asked Fabiano and he gave me the following two references, we can discuss them.

######## REVIEWER #2 ########

We thank the reviewer for reading our article in detail, and providing many insightful and useful comments. We’ve replied to each separate comment below.

===== COMMENT #1
I think that the relatively simple argument structures are appealing in the sense that the overhead for practical application may be tolerable. However, this remains to be shown yet in an industrial environment. 

===== REPLY #1
We have added a section "Validation" (Section 7) where we describe the results of a validation. Please see REPLY #3 to REVIEWER #1 for more details.

===== COMMENT #2
The statement on actually using a reduced GRL should be made in the Abstract and Introduction already, not just in a footnote later.

===== REPLY #2
We have included in the abstract and introduction that we use a simplified version. Note that all the core elements of GRL are included but, for example, we have included only one level of contribution strength, where GRL contains different levels of positive and negative contribution. This simplification does not in any way influence the case study or any of the other results. Furthermore, extending the GRL part of RationalGRL to include the full set of GRL elements would not change the essence of our formalism.

===== COMMENT #3
I think that the paper should compare the proposed argumentation structure at least with the beliefs in GRL. In general, how does this argumentation approach really differ from one based on beliefs and, in particular, belief revision? Assume that an argument is a belief of some stakeholder revised by another argument, which is a belief of some other stakeholder?

===== REPLY #3
We have added a comparison between arguments in RationalGRL and beliefs in GRL in the related work section, at the beginning of the paragraph "Goal Modelling". 

The comparison between argumentation and belief revision is interesting, especially from a theoretical point of view. In the area of knowledge representation, obtaining correspondences between beliefs revision and the dynamics of argumentation theory is a popular topic of research [12,13,14,15]. However, since studying relations between argumentation and belief revision does not seem directly related to our current framework and seems more interesting from a formal logical point of view, we have left this out of the discussion in our paper, instead choosing to focus on beliefs in GRL.

===== COMMENT #4
How would you compare this specific approach with the old gIBIS?

===== REPLY #4
%FB: **Floris to write on gIBIS in 7.1**

===== COMMENT #5
Please discuss why you are trying to have detailed, while simple, rationale, although the recent trend in DR is otherwise?

===== REPLY #5
%FB: **Floris to write on this in 7.1**

===== COMMENT #6
I wonder about the formalization in propositional logic. Why is it not used for automated reasoning (at least partly instead of the specific algorithms)?

===== REPLY #6
Propositional logic in itself does not contain specific algorithms for, for example, INTRO, REPLACE and DISABLE. Furthermore, the algorithms also introduce arguments and attacks, formal notions of which are not in basic propositional logic. The idea is that the formalization is needed for the algorithms, but that just providing a formal semantics of GRL does not directly tell you how to compute/reason with GRL models.

===== COMMENT #7
I am also missing a discussion about the consequences of this binary "nature" of argumentation with respect to argumentation in reality.

===== REPLY #7
%FB: **Floris to write on this in 5.2**

===== COMMENT #8
Regarding terminology, I wonder about "valid" GRL models here, which seem to mean that certain criteria are fulfilled. Validation would mean that a goal model makes sense in the real world as having the "right" goals and relationships between them.

===== REPLY #8
We agree that the term “valid” is confusing in this respect, since we do not want to express that the goal model makes sense in the real world. Instead, we’d like to express that certain criteria are fulfilled. Therefore, we’ve renamed “valid” to “consistent”. 
TODO(marcvanzee): Implement this renaming in the article.

===== COMMENT #9
"Verification" in 6.2 appears to stand for evaluation. This cannot be "verified".

===== REPLY #9
We have renamed “verification” to “demonstration” and slightly reworded the sentence.

===== COMMENT #10
I also do not think that Figure 16 shows a "methodology". It does not even look like a "method".

===== REPLY #10
We agree that the terminology is wrong. We have renamed the methodology to "The RationalGRL development process", since it defines the steps on how to create a RationalGRL model. We have renamed this throughout the entire article.

===== COMMENT #11
please reconsider the very first sentences in the Abstract and Introduction each, especially the latter statement on RE

===== REPLY #11
We agree with the reviewer that the two mentioned sentences are confusing. We have improved this as follows:
- We have rewritten the first sentence of the abstract as follows: "Goal-oriented requirements modeling approaches aim at capturing intentions of various stakeholders involved in the development of an information system and refining them into low level goals and tasks."
- We have deleted the first sentence of the introduction, since we feel that it is not necessary to explain the definition of Requirements Engineering in the Requirements Engineering Journal.

===== COMMENT #12
Finally, you should run a spell checker, have a careful proof reading of grammar, and make sure that there is no unresolved reference to a figure in a submitted manuscript.

===== REPLY #11
We’ve ran a spell-checker and proof-read the paper carefully. There was one unresolved reference to a figure, which a corrected. Thank you for pointing this out.
