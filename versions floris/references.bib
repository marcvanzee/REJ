In many enterprises, however, such an integrated vi ew of the entire enterprise is still far from reality. To deal with these challenges, an integrated view of the enterprise is needed, enabling impact and change analysis covering all relevant aspects. This need sparked the development of the ArchiMate language. This paper is concerned with documenting some of the key design decisions and design principles underlying the ArchiMate language.},

The book is based on ISO15704:2000, or the GERAM Framework (Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology) that generalises the requirements of Enterprise Reference Architectures. Various Architecture Frameworks (PERA, CIMOSA, Grai-GIM, Zachman, C4ISR/DoDAF) are shown in light of GERAM to allow a deeper understanding of their contributions and therefore their correct and knowledgeable use. The handbook addresses a wide variety of audience, and covers methods and tools necessary to design or redesign enterprises, as well as to structure the implementation into manageable projects. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider the relation between beliefs and goals in agent theory. Beliefs play three roles in reasoning about goals: they play a role in the generation of unconditional desires from condi- tional ones, they play a role in adoption of desires as goals, and they play a role in the selection of plans to achieve goals. In this paper we consider the role of goals in reasoning about beliefs. Though we assume that goals do not play a role in the belief generation problem, we argue that they play a role in the belief selection problem. We show the rationality of the use of goals in belief selection, in the sense that there are cases in which agents that take their goals into account in selecting a belief set from a set of alternatives outperform agents that do not do so. We also formally distinguish between the rational role of goals in belief selection and irrational wishful thinking.},

  Abstract                 = {Networked constellations are often formed to provide commercial IT services by leveraging the Internet technology. The provision of IT services should remain scalable, meaning that they should remain both economically and technically deployable in different business configurations. The same requirements hold for the Distributed Balancing Service (DBS), which is the subject of our analysis. In this paper we assess potentials of system scale of a constellation during its early design phase. We address a multiperspective analysis approach, by taking a business value (using e3-value) and an information system perspective (using UML) on the case at hand. We present a structured approach to relate both perspectives, thus enabling a cross perspective assessment of system scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Enterprises, from small to large, evolve continuously. As a result, their structures are transformed and extended continuously. Without some means of control, such changes are bound to lead to an overly complex, uncoordinated and heterogeneous environment that is hard to manage and hard to adapt to future changes. Enterprise architecture principles provide a means to direct transformations of enterprises. As a consequence, architecture principles should be seen as the cornerstones of any architecture.
In this book, Greefhorst and Proper focus on the role of architecture principles. They provide both a theoretical and a practical perspective on architecture principles. The theoretical perspective involves a brief survey of the general concept of principle as well as an analysis of different flavors of principles. Architecture principles are regarded as a specific class of normative principles that direct the design of an enterprise, from the definition of its business to its supporting IT. The practical perspective on architecture principles is concerned with an approach to the formulation of architecture principles, as well as their actual use in organizations. To illustrate their use in practice, several real-life cases are discussed, an application of architecture principles in TOGAF is included, and a catalogue of example architecture principles is provided.
With this broad coverage, the authors target students and researchers specializing in enterprise architecture or business information systems, as well as practitioners who want to understand the foundations underlying their practical daily work.},

  Abstract                 = {A coherent description of an enterprise architecture provides insight, enables communication among stakeholders and guides complicated change processes. Unfortunately, so far no enterprise architecture description language exists that fully enables integrated enterprise modelling, because for each architectural domain, architects use their own modelling techniques and concepts, tool support, visualisation techniques, etc. In this paper we outline such an integrated language and we identify and study concepts that relate architectural domains. In our language concepts for describing the relationships between architecture descriptions at the business, application, and technology levels play a central role, related to the ubiquitous problem of business IT alignment, whereas for each architectural domain we conform to existing languages or standards such as UML. In particular, usage of services offered by one layer to another plays an important role in relating the behaviour aspects of the layers. The structural aspects of the layers are linked through the interface concept, and the information aspects through realisation relations. },

  Abstract                 = {In current business practice, an integrated approach to business and IT is indispensable. In many enterprises, however, such an integrated view of the entire enterprise is still far from reality. To deal with these challenges, an integrated view of the enterprise is needed, enabling impact/change analysis covering all relevant aspects. This need sparked the development of the ArchiMate language, which was developed with the explicit intention of becoming an open standard, and as such has been designed such that it is extendable while still maintaining a clear and orthogonal structure. This article is concerned with documenting some of the key structures and design principles underlying the ArchiMate language. ArchiMate is designed as an architecture description language (ADL) for enterprise architectures. The authors will start by discussing the challenges facing the design of an architecture description language. Consequently we discuss how the design principles of the ArchiMate language aim to tackle these challenges. They then continue with a discussion of the modelling concepts needed. In this, we make a distinction between concepts needed to model domains in general, the modelling of dynamic systems, and the modelling of enterprise architectures.},

  Abstract                 = {In a range of contexts, one comes across processes resembling inference, but where input propositions are not in general included among outputs, and the operation is not in any way reversible. Examples arise in contexts of conditional obligations, goals, ideals, preferences, actions, and beliefs. Our purpose is to develop a theory of such input/output operations. Four are singled out: simpleminded, basic (making intelligent use of disjunctive inputs), simple-minded reusable (in which outputs may be recycled as inputs), and basic reusable. They are defined semantically and characterised by derivation rules, as well as in terms of relabeling procedures and modal operators. Their behaviour is studied on both semantic and syntactic levels.},

  Abstract                 = {TOGAF is a framework - a detailed method and a set of supporting tools - for developing an enterprise architecture, developed by members of The Open Group Architecture Forum. TOGAF Version 9 provides a wide-ranging set of revisions to the TOGAF specification to improve the value of the TOGAF framework. It is an evolution from TOGAF 8.1.1, thereby preserving existing investment in TOGAF, and adds further detail and clarification to what is already proven. It may be used freely by any organization wishing to develop an enterprise architecture for use within that organization (subject to the Conditions of Use). In this book, you will find answers to questions such as: What is an architecture framework? What kind of 'architecture' are we talking about? How does my organization benefit from using TOGAF?},

This specification supports linguistic analysis of text for business vocabulary and rules, with the linguistic analysis itself being outside the scope of this specification. This specification is applicable to the domain of business vocabulary and business rules of all kinds of business activities of all kinds of organizations. It is conceptualized optimally for business people rather than automated rules processing, and is designed to be used for business purposes, independent of information systems designs. This specification is applicable as input to transformations by IT staff into information system designs, using a combination of decisions from system architects and Platform Independent Model designers together with software tool function. },

  Abstract                 = {Twenty years after the first publications and books on enterprisearchitecture, the domain is evolving from a technology-driven towards a more business-driven approach, thus empowering decision makers to adapt and transform an enterprise in order to keep up with changing business needs. At the same time the discipline of enterprise architecting has matured, leading to a better understanding of the profession of an enterprise architect. With this book, the authors aim to provide an overview of enterprise architecture including the process of creating, applying and maintaining it, thus taking into account the perspectives of CxOs, business managers, enterprise architects, solution architects, designers and engineers. They explore the results that are produced as part of an enterprise architecture, the process by which these are produced, and the role the architect plays in this process. As such, they do not describe a specific method for developing an enterprise (IT) architecture, nor do they define a specific modeling language for enterprise architecture, rather they offer the reader a fundamental way of thinking about enterprise architecture, which will enable him to select and apply the right approach, architecture framework and tools that meet the objective and context of the architecture work at hand. This approach is emphasized by discussion statements at the end of each chapter, sparking thoughts about benefits, shortcomings, and future research directions. Covering both theoretical foundations and practical use, and written in close collaboration between industry professionals and academic lecturers, Enterprise Architecture thus offers an ideal introduction for students in areas like business information systems or management science, as well as guidance and background for professionals seeking a more thorough understanding of their field of work. },

  Abstract                 = {A general theory of explanation-based decision making is outlined and the multiple roles of inference processes in the theory are indicated. A typology of formal and informal inference forms, originally proposed by Collins (1978a, 1978b), is introduced as an appropriate framework to represent inferences that occur in the overarching explanation-based process. Results from the analysis of verbal reports of decision processes are presented to demonstrate the centrality and systematic character of reasoning in a representative legal decision-making task. },

  Abstract                 = {This is one of the few business books that dare address the central issue for most companies today: How to establish competitively-advantaged business models for serving customers that capture the power of the Internet to work with others. Anyone who doesn't know what they want to do for an Internet-based business model or doesn't like the one they have will get great benefit from this book. Like Blown to Bits, Digital Capital looks squarely at the economic impact of the Internet on existing business models. But Digital Capital goes further in laying out the necessary steps to build on five business models that have been working that involve creating business networks that are Internet enabled (b-webs in the parlance of this book).
You will instantly recognize the five business model types, because the authors provide lots of examples (at least some of which will be familiar to you) and lists of characteristics of each type.
You will also know how to go from where you are to reaching one of these archetypes by the strategy directions the authors provide. The only drawback of this section is that the language gets a little b-schoolish (and full of very long words).
The conceptual basis of the work is sound. The only two points that were not discussed were (1) how these models might evolve into more powerful models in the future, and (2) how they might merge with each other.
Where the book is at its best is in helping you think through how to add other companies into a related web of interests to get more done -- thinking that goes well beyond the well-known outsourcing mindset.
Good luck with improving your Internet-based business model! Keep in mind that technology will evolve rapidly and enable some new business models that can only be dreamed about today in just 3-5 years. So be sure to look at the irresistible forces of technology development in thinking ahead.},

  Abstract                 = {We put Object-Role Modeling (ORM) to work in the context of the creation of System Dynamics (SD) models. SD focuses on the structure and behavior of systems composed of interacting feedback loops. The art of SD modeling lies in discovering and representing the feedback processes and other elements that determine the dynamics of the system (typically, a process in an organization). However, SD shows a lack of instruments for discovering and expressing precise, language-based concepts in domains. At the same time, the field of conceptual modeling has long since focused on deriving models from natural expressions. We therefore turn to ORM as a prime example of this school of thought to integrate its strong natural language based modeling approach into the creation of SD models. A two step schema based approach for transforming an ORM domain model into a SD stock and flow diagram is presented. We discuss how typical ORM conceptualization can be linked to SD conceptualization and how such a transformation can be performed. Examples are provided},

  Abstract                 = {System development is a process in which communication plays an important role. Requirements must be elicited from various stakeholders. But stakeholders also make decisions and must understand the consequences thereof. Different viewpoints must be reconciled, and agreements reached. An important assumption we make is that all actions in the development process are (or should be) based on rational decisions. The quest for rationality is a driving force behind the communication that takes place within the development process, because it raises issues that may otherwise have remained in the subconsciousness of stakeholders. We zoom in on the role of vagueness in communication, and argue that there are good reasons not to try and formalize things too soon in the development process. The purpose of this paper is to position our ongoing research, encourage discussion about the assumptions we make, and inspire novel approaches to system development. We work towards a comprehensive theory of rational system development, in which due attention is paid to development processes, communication, and the representations used therein. },
