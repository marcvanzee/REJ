\hline
0:15:42.3 (P1) & Well, all intersection should have traffic lights so it's & \textbf{[21 critical question CQ*1 for 20]} Is the task ``Add traffic light'' useful/redundant? \newline
\textbf{[22 answer to 22]} Not useful, because according to the specification all intersections have traffic lights.\\
\hline
0:15:52.3 (P1) & (..) And on the technical side it's gonna be a real pain to remove one intersection you're gonna have to remove a lot more because there are only four-ways allowed and if you remove one intersection then-& \textbf{[23 critical question CQ2 for 20]} Is the task ``Remove intersection'' possible?\newline

\hline
0:23:41.2 (P2) & (..) If you can only control the set amount of influx from any side of this sort of random distribution, I think that is going to be less interesting than when you can say something like, this road is frequently traveled. (...) So setting it per road, I think is something we want & \textbf{[33 critical question CQ*2 on 36]} Is the task description specific/clear enough? \newline
\textbf{[34 answer to 37]} No, it is not clear where the influx is changing. Change to ``control car influx per road''\\

\cline{1-2}
0:06:36.0 (P1) & Yeah, performance versus, I don't know, functionality. Like, what you say, cars come out at the end of the map side [are generated randomly] is performance wise and, I don't know, easier to make but it is less functional. Because you can't see traffic flows that easy because, well there's fixed amount of cars so there's not really gonna be jams [the simulation is less dynamic].
