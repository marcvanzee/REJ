Goal modeling languages capture the relations between an information system and its environment using high-level goals and their relationships with lower level goals and tasks. The process of constructing a goal model usually involves discussions between a requirements engineer and a group of stakeholders. While it is possible to capture part of this discussion process in a goal model, for instance by specifying alternative solutions for a goal, not all of the arguments can be found in the resulting model. For instance, reasons for accepting or rejecting an element or a relation between two elements are not captured. In this paper, we investigate to what extent argumentation techniques from artificial intelligence can be applied to a goal modelingn approach. We apply the argument scheme for practical reasoning (PRAS), which is used in AI to reason about goals to the Goal-oriented Requirements Language (GRL). We develop a formal metamodel for the new language, link it to the GRL metamodel, and we implement our extension into jUCMNav, the Eclipse-based open source tool for GRL.

%SG: what are the findings? or what case study we are using? 
%SG_New: I still have these comments!
