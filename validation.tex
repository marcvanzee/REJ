\subsection{RationalGRL user evaluation}

Since RationalGRL is targeted at practitioners and not just for academic end users, we performed a brief user evaluation with 20 users. In this evaluation, we asked participants to rate and comment the usability of the RationalGRL tool. The study consisted of three parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explanation: We explained the participants the basics of the RationalGRL methodology and the RationalGRL tool in a document we wrote.
\item Modelling: We asked the participants to model a summarized discussion in the RationalGRL tool.
\item Questionnaire: We asked some questions about the usability of the RationalGRL tool, and how it relates to GRL.
\end{enumerate}

The instructions for these three parts were contained in a single document that we sent out to the participants.\footnote{See \url{www.rationalgrl.com}, page ``Empirical Study''} At the end of the document we provided a link to the survey\footnote{https://goo.gl/forms/fDSMUnAV20wy7kbY2}.

In the second task, the users were asked to visit rationalgrl.com, where they could start experimenting with the RationalGRL tool directly. We presented the users with summarized transcripts of the discussion about the development of the Traffic Controller, and then asked them to model this to the best of their abilities.

For the third task, we asked the users to fill out a survey. The survey starts by asking about the usersâ€™ backgrounds. The participants turned out to have a relatively high level of experience with
IT, with an average rating of.... Experience
with goal modeling was less....

\subsection{Evaluation with Enterprise Architects}

\todo{marcvanzee}{marcvanzee,floris,sepideh}{This is copied from the CAiSE paper where we did the original evaluation with two Enterprise Architects. I'm not sure if we can re-use it. The main problem is that at that time we developed GRL models specifically for the organization in which the Enterprise Architects were working, and we don't have such a model now. What do you think?}

To ensure GRL models captured the essence of the EA principles correctly, we evaluated the models with two Enterprise Architects from eGovernment. The
architects found the GRL models very useful in that they could visualize the principles and were easier for them to understand the links between the rationale, added value, actions and the goals of the principles. Furthermore, since the EA
principles were linked to the high-level goals of the organization, it made them easier to justify and analyze. Also, we captured the traceability links between the related EA principles which helped the architects to document the links and
verify the connections.

The architects also informed us that assigning values for contribution links can be done at design time together with the architects.
We aim to extend our models to more principles and provide analysis of the principles with high-level goals as well as low-level operationalized activities of the organization.
