\subsection{Evaluation with Enterprise Architects}

\todo{marcvanzee}{marcvanzee,floris}{This is copied from the CAiSE paper where we did the original evaluation with two Enterprise Architects. I'm not sure if we can re-use it. The main problem is that at that time we developed GRL models specifically for the organization in which the Enterprise Architects were working, and we don't have such a model now. What do you think?}

To ensure GRL models captured the essence of the EA principles correctly, we evaluated the models with two Enterprise Architects from eGovernment. The
architects found the GRL models very useful in that they could visualize the principles and were easier for them to understand the links between the rationale, added value, actions and the goals of the principles. Furthermore, since the EA
principles were linked to the high-level goals of the organization, it made them easier to justify and analyze. Also, we captured the traceability links between the related EA principles which helped the architects to document the links and
verify the connections.

The architects also informed us that assigning values for contribution links can be done at design time together with the architects.
We aim to extend our models to more principles and provide analysis of the principles with high-level goals as well as low-level operationalized activities of the organization.
