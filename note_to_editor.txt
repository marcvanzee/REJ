Dear Prof Loucopoulos,

In our major revision, we have spent significant effort to address or reply to all of the comments of the second reviewer. We hope it is possible to come to a final verdict this time using an external expert. Furthermore, we kindly ask that the external reviewer will be able to see the reviews and replies of all the previous review cycles, so that he or she will be able to make a verdict based on all the information.

Thank you in advance, and we look forward to the reviews.

Kind regards,

Marc van Zee, Floris Bex, and Sepideh Ghanavati
